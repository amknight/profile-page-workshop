    GIVE ME THE DATA!
    ------------
    For now, our data store is a file.
    In the future, you can think of this as being
    another 'server' or storage solution, maybe a:
    - database (MySQL, Postgres);
    - compressed file (zip, gzip);
    - txt file (.txt, .csv)
    The possibilities are endless!

    BEGINNINGS OF A UI
    ------------
    Here, we start 'composing' our UI. Similar to the examples
    we saw in the earlier presentation, we are starting to
    include and define smaller portions of our UI.
    The overall structure of our Profile Page is:
    ---------------------------------------------
      (o) DARK MODE TOGGLE
    ---------------------------------------------
          HEADER (w/ Avatar, Name, ...)
    ---------------------------------------------
          BODY (w/ TabList, Cards, ...)
    ---------------------------------------------
    Here, we start including these different parts.

    ADDING STYLE
    ------------

    CSS stylesheets for sprucin' up the page!
    -> colours.css contains references to different
       colours being used throughout the application;
    -> App.css contains CSS specific to the App component
       we are currently defining in JavaScript!

  "Export" allows the component to be imported and used in other files.

  for React (with one class per file). The alternative is "named exports",
